hi myself diljith 

i completed my btech graduation as a a mechanical engineer

then i was working as a engineer for almost 2 year

then during the initial lockdown i found a random video about to test yourself wheather you are capable of coding,it was a basics of coding on java and i found it interesting

then i took another challenge of creating a static website creation with html,css,bootstarp

i was fancied by the way of development ,you dont need to learn completely ,get the basics then its all about research and development

then i took a udemy course of complete web development tutorial completed but i didnt find the perfect area for me,then i decided to switch my carrer to it, i know its a risk with 2 year of experience,but i believe  if its right job you can suceed in life ,

so i planned for myself ,so to get some financial backing i got into a inside sales job,worked for 9 months also learning, then i found the gem flutter and explored the pro and cons of flutter,started learning flutter my a udemy course and various  youtube resouces,stackoverflow,discord channels
i created a couplke of projects with different backends
